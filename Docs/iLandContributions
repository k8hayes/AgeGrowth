# Methods
iLand is an process-based landscape model that simulates growth, mortality and competition at the tree scale. Using principles of resource and light availability, iLand simulates growth, competition, mortality and regeneration of individual trees within a spatially-explicit landscape. Characterersitics of climate (daily temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation and vapor pressure deficit) and soil (percent sand, silt, clay, effective depth and nutrient availability) are homogenous within stands (1 ha). 

The model has been well tested and applied in Alaska [@hansen2021]. 

## Initial conditions
We initialized iLand with data from 
Soil information for each site was extracted from the global SoilGrids250m database (effective soil depth from v1.0 and percent sand, silt and clay from v2.0, [@hengl2017]).

## Parameterization

## Simulation experiment
We simulated the outcome of extending the exclusion of herbivores for an additional XX years.
Stands were simulated with and without the exclusion of herbivores under daily climate conditions taken from the 1-km Daymet product randomly recycled with replacement across 2005-2015.
